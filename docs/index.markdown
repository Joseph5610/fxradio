Play thousands of radio stations from all around the world. Find out which stations are currently most rated by other listeners. Create your personal favourite stations list. If your favourite station is not in our database, you can simply add it with just a few clicks! 


#### Free, modern & open source
FXRadio is an open-source project made in author's free time and is completly free of charge. You can download the app from the link provided on top of this website.

The app implements 2 types of media players. VLClib player, which requires VLC player to be installed on your system is currently our recommended player. VLC player is a free multimedia player which supports majority of radio stations listed in our app. If you cannot install it on your system, you can still use our app with our custom media player, however it currently has some limitations and some station might not play. We are always working on improving our custom player.

The app is writen in Kotlin using [TornadoFX](https://tornadofx.io) framework. If you want to contribute and make FXRadio better, we would be more than happy.

The app is using [radio-browser.info](http://radio-browser.info) public API as the source of radio stations.
